                Here’s an interesting story about the origin of one of the most gratifying dishes on this planet. It originated in the 
                1950s in Moti Mahal Restaurant, Daryaganj, a neighbourhood skirting the Walled City. Known for its Tandoori Chicken, the
                cooks there accidentally tossed the sauce consisting of butter, tomato and chicken juices with tandoori chicken pieces;
                the rest is history. Today, this dish can be found in almost every non-vegetarian restaurant and highway dhabas and is best
                enjoyed with rice or naan.Where can I try this dish? Moti Mahal, Daryaganj; Havemore, Pandara Road
