            Baga is a famous beach destination in North Goa that attracts thousands of tourists and watersports lovers to its heart.  The beach shares its coastal line
             from the environs of Sinquerim, Candolim, and Baga, with the Baga shore being more lively and enticing. This bubbly beach is one of the best in Goa that
              stays awake the whole night. Called as "The Hometown of Nightlife," Baga beach is reputed for its cranky music celebrations by late-night, mouth-watering
               food, designer shops, and adventure sports.

            Tourism in Goa’s coasts got ignited by 1960 after the famous summer gathering of hippies from San Francisco. Baga beach then became popular among 
            foreigners and slowly more exciting ventures like fishing, paddleboarding, discos, and tattoo shops started in the mainland. Named after “Baga Creek in
             Baga”, the tidal residuary channel that drains into the Arabian sea, Baga beach in Goa is also well organized with parking facilities and is maintained 
             tidy by the local governing authorities, besides experiencing hordes of travelers clubbing around. 

            Baga town is surrounded by the Baga river, and spotting the place where the river and the “sea meet, is a beautiful view to bait your eyes. Dolphins can 
            also spotted deeper in the blue ocean and there are some spotting trips organized by local ship owners to spot the sea mammal.

        <p class="detail">
            The Dudhsagar Waterfalls are situated on the Goa-Karnataka border and are one of India’s must-see sights. The four-tiered waterfall structure is one of the 
            tallest in India and is located on the Mandovi River. The white water cascades down from a height of nearly 1017 feet off a nearly steep mountain face. They
             form a part of the Bhagwan Mahaveer Sanctuary and Mollem National Park, so the best way to reach them is by entering the national park and taking a van
              allocated by the park to the falls.
           The Dudhsagar trek inside the park is closed to the public but you can still reach the waterfalls by trekking from Kulem and following the jeep trail. 
           Another possible route is the trek from Castle Rock in Karnataka. Reaching the waterfalls will not be an easy task but it is one that is worth every ounce
            of effort put into it.  They are best experienced during the monsoons as they lose their force during the dry season.

          Many tours are organized over this time so you can choose to go as a part of a group. Some tours even have overnight camping options. But remember to go 
          well-prepared to ensure a good experience, especially if you are going on a self-organized trek. The lush green jungle and the beautiful waterfall sending 
          up their forceful sprays are a sight to remember long after you have left Dudhsagar behind.

         Location: Sanguem Taluka

        How to reach from Panaji: Take a train up to Kulem railway station. However, don’t expect a proper platform here. It is a rough stop.
